# Contour

##Purpose

Contour is intended to augment the functionality provided by Scouts Terrain.

Contour also provides an opportunity to test functionality or fixes before those changes are put to the Terrain development team for incorporation into the core system.

##Operation

Contour is completely client-side. It stores no user data and runs cmpletely within the Chrome web browser. It is bound by existing Terrain management systems, such as user permissions, security checks and logging of actions within Terrain for auditing purposes.

Contour simply interfaces with the same information and functionality as normal Terrain, just in a different (and hopefully more effective and efficient) way.
